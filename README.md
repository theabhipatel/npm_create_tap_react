# 🎨 Create Tap React

An interactive CLI tool to bootstrap your React.js projects with ready-to-use templates.  
Just like `create-next-app`, but with modern **React + TypeScript** setups (including upcoming **Auth & Dashboard** templates).

---

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Choose from multiple pre-configured templates
- 🎨 Interactive CLI with project name & setup prompts
- ⚡ Installs dependencies automatically (supports **npm**, **yarn**, and **pnpm**)
- ✅ Ready-to-use React setup with TypeScript
- 🚧 More templates (Auth, Dashboard) coming soon!

## 📦 Installation & Usage

You don’t need to install anything globally. Just run:

```bash
npx create-tap-react
```

### Example Flow

```bash
npx create-tap-react
```

👉 CLI will guide you:

```
🚀 Welcome to create-tap-react!

🎨 Select a template:
❯ React.js with TypeScript (Basic setup) -  React with TypeScript and all Basic setup
  React.js with Shadcn (Auth setup) - Coming Soon
  React.js Dashboard with Shadcn (Auth setup) - Coming Soon

📝 Project name: my-app
```

Then it will:

1. Clone the selected template into `my-app`
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager
3. Show you next steps

✅ Example output:

```
📦 Creating project in my-app...
🎨 Using template: React.js with TypeScript (Basic setup)
